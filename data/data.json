However, this initial curiosity turned into a obsession of mine and I delved into the Science behind how high voltage is generated. I made my first Tesla coil at the end of P6. However it was barely functioning and incredibly low powered. This set me off on a path to make a better and more powerful tesla coil which eventually led to me making my second Tesla coil.",
